# Processing, Regressions, and Web Deployment of Bioinformatic Data

## Overview

This project involves the use of Python to clean, preprocess, build machine learning models, and eventually deploy that ML model using a web app.
This repository includes five notebooks, each containing one project phase, and app.py, which contains the web app code.

Primary Libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, streamlit

## Phase 1: Data Collection, Preprocessing

## Phase 2: Data Analysis

## Phase 3: Descriptor Calculation

## Phase 4: Building, Comparing ML Models

## Phase 5: Deployment of Model
